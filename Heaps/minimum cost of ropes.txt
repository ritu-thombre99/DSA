There are given N ropes of different lengths, we need to connect these ropes into one rope. The cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths

class Solution
{
    public:
    //Function to return the minimum cost of connecting the ropes.
    long long minCost(long long arr[], long long n) {
        // Your code here
        priority_queue<long long,vector<long long>,greater<long long>> pq;
        for(long long i=0;i<n;i++)
            pq.push(arr[i]);
        long long cost = 0;
        while(pq.size()!=1)
        {
            long long rope1 = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            long long rope2 = pq.top();
            pq.pop();
            pq.push(rope1+rope2);
            cost = cost+rope1+rope2;
        }
        return cost;
    }
};
