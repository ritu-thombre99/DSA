he9ight of binary tree

gp sum = a(r^n - 1)/(r-1) if r>0
here a always = 1
r always = 2
therefore n represents height
i.e height = log10(number of nodes)/log10(2)


class Solution{
public:
    int heapHeight(int N, int arr[]){
        // code here
        return log10(N)/log10(2);
    }
};
