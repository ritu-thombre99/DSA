Given an array of length N, starting from 1 to N. At each iteration, you remove all elements at odd positions, until only one element is left. Find the last remaining element.


Input:
N = 5
Output:
4
Explanation:
Initial Array- {1,2,3,4,5}.
After 1st Iteration- {2,4}.
After 2nd Interation- {4}
Threfore, the answer is 4.


class Solution {
  public:
    long long oddGame(long long N) {
        // code here
        return pow(2,floor(log10(N)/log10(2)));
    }
};
