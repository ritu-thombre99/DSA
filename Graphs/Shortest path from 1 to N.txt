Consider a directed graph whose vertices are numbered from 1 to n. There is an edge from a vertex i to a vertex j iff either j = i + 1 or j = 3 * i. The task is to find the minimum number of edges in a path in G from vertex 1 to vertex n.

class Solution{   
public:
    int minimumStep(int n){
        //complete the function here
        if(n==1)
            return 0;
        else if(n%3 == 0 and n/3 >=1 )
            return 1+minimumStep(n/3);
        else
            return 1+minimumStep(n-1);
    }
};
