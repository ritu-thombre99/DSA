Weakly connected components

1. Underlying undirected component of a given Directed graph is connected. 
   I.e possible to traverse u->v and v->u in undirected counterpart but (u->v & v->u) path not necessarily present in the directed graph.

Algorithm - DFS/BFS to count the number of components of the graph
each connected component in UNDIRECTED graph is WCC in DIRECTED GRAPH
